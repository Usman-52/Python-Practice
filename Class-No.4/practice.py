#?=========================================== TUPLE =================================================#
#* Tuple is the built-in data structure which can store ordered , immutable and heterogenous data 
#* Key points:
#* Ordered: the data would be in sequence
#* Immutable: you can't change, modify the data after creating the tuple.

my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(my_tuple)
